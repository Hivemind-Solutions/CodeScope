How to live monitor for a phrase being typed...

example commands to look for:

/cs python tree.

then replaces on the line you were ending in while deleting the command typed to this output...

			## anytree
			I recommend https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anytree (I am the author)

			### Example

			   from anytree import Node, RenderTree
			   
			   udo = Node("Udo")
			   marc = Node("Marc", parent=udo)
			   lian = Node("Lian", parent=marc)
			   dan = Node("Dan", parent=udo)
			   jet = Node("Jet", parent=dan)
			   jan = Node("Jan", parent=dan)
			   joe = Node("Joe", parent=dan)
			   
			   print(udo)
			   Node('/Udo')
			   print(joe)
			   Node('/Udo/Dan/Joe')
			   
			   for pre, fill, node in RenderTree(udo):
			       print("%s%s" % (pre, node.name))
			   Udo
			   ├── Marc
			   │   └── Lian
			   └── Dan
			       ├── Jet
			       ├── Jan
			       └── Joe
			   
			   print(dan.children)
			   (Node('/Udo/Dan/Jet'), Node('/Udo/Dan/Jan'), Node('/Udo/Dan/Joe'))

			### Features
			anytree (http://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has also a powerful API with:


			    * simple tree creation
			    * simple tree modification
			    * pre-order tree iteration
			    * post-order tree iteration
			    * resolve relative and absolute node paths 
			    * walking from one node to an other.
			    * tree rendering (see example above)
			    * node attach/detach hookups

			/cs new file in python. 

Make undo and redo functions such as described below:

/cs undo.
/cs redo.
