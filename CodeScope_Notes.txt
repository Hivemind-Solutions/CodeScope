How to live monitor for a phrase being typed...

example commands to look for:

/cs python tree.

then replaces on the line you were ending in while deleting the command typed to this output...

			## anytree
			I recommend https://pypi.python.org/pypi/anytree (I am the author)

			### Example

			   from anytree import Node, RenderTree
			   
			   udo = Node("Udo")
			   marc = Node("Marc", parent=udo)
			   lian = Node("Lian", parent=marc)
			   dan = Node("Dan", parent=udo)
			   jet = Node("Jet", parent=dan)
			   jan = Node("Jan", parent=dan)
			   joe = Node("Joe", parent=dan)
			   
			   print(udo)
			   Node('/Udo')
			   print(joe)
			   Node('/Udo/Dan/Joe')
			   
			   for pre, fill, node in RenderTree(udo):
			       print("%s%s" % (pre, node.name))
			   Udo
			   ├── Marc
			   │   └── Lian
			   └── Dan
			       ├── Jet
			       ├── Jan
			       └── Joe
			   
			   print(dan.children)
			   (Node('/Udo/Dan/Jet'), Node('/Udo/Dan/Jan'), Node('/Udo/Dan/Joe'))

			### Features
			anytree (http://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has also a powerful API with:


			    * simple tree creation
			    * simple tree modification
			    * pre-order tree iteration
			    * post-order tree iteration
			    * resolve relative and absolute node paths 
			    * walking from one node to an other.
			    * tree rendering (see example above)
			    * node attach/detach hookups

			/cs new file in python. 

Make undo and redo functions such as described below:

/cs undo.
/cs redo.


TO DO's:

Make a varible with the path


- Find a way to look for commands in text you just typed... this is gonna be fugged...
- Setup the parsing logic for copy and pasting code

what is open?
store as a keys (or 2d array) (or a map)
search the directory 

give the path to the file ()

parse the text of the file to see keywords 

after keyphrase found

look it up how2 on terminal

fetch the output and clean the output

copy the ouput

locate the file agian 

appending output

functions (terminaltofile)
